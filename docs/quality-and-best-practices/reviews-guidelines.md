Reviews are an integral part of the online shopping experience, and people installing software pay attention to them. Prospective users of your plugins will likely consider average ratings when making software choices.

Many of today’s most popular online review platforms — from Yelp business reviews, to Amazon product reviews — have a range of opinion that can be polarized, with many extremely positive and/or negative reviews, and fewer moderate opinions. This creates a “J-shaped” distribution of reviews that isn’t as accurate or as helpful as could be.

WooCommerce.com and WordPress.org both feature reviews heavily, and competing plugins having a higher rating likely have the edge in user choice. 

## First considerations around reviews

Requesting more reviews for a plugin with major issues will not generate good reviews, and analyzing existing reviews will help surface areas to address before soliciting reviews.

It’s extremely rare for users of WordPress plugins to leave reviews organically (.2% of users for WordPress.org), which means that there’s an untapped market of 99.8% of users of the average plugin.

These plugins are competing with other plugins on the same search terms in the WordPress.org plugin directory, and ratings are a large factor in the ranking algorithm. This is not usually a factor to the same extent on the MP (for instance, our PayPal plugin directly competes on all possible keywords with other PayPal extensions on the WordPress.org repository, while it does not compete with other PayPal payments plugins on the MP.)

## How to request reviews

### Admin notices

Admin notices are industry standard methods of requesting reviews, but bombarding the admin dashboard is not effective. We recommend using restraint in the design of the notice, as well as limiting to a single notice at a time. It’s very easy to overwhelm merchants with too many notices, or too intrusive notices.

#### Recommendations:

* A good place for an admin notice to review a plugin would be to show on the plugin pages and settings pages.
* Have a snooze option (or multiples!) with a clear expectation of when the notice will reappear.
* It needs to always be completely dismissable. It cannot just have a snooze option.
* The options presented in the notice must be phrased carefully to avoid manipulative language in the options.
* Use consistently designed notices, so the request for reviews feels like a part of your plugin, and looks consistent with WooCommerce design.

### Direct contact

#### Recommendations

* The most direct route to requesting reviews with the highest chance of being positive is to contact the customer when they are the happiest with the product.
* This can be milestone or time based, following the timing guidelines below.
* The best method for this is either an email or other direct exchange (support chat, call, etc.). This has the highest conversion rate, especially when timed properly so that the customer is happiest.
* This is also extremely effective when you are able to request feedback from specifically qualified merchants, such as merchants that have processed a certain amount with your platform, or who have shipped their first 100 orders using your fulfillment plugin, or similar.
* Direct outreach is most likely to be successful if you have ways of targeting users for review requests (merchant account / usage info, etc.), as well as ways to gather the reviews, like sales or marketing teams able to email/call/chat with merchants.


## When to request reviews

Think about who is seeing the notification, and what they are doing at that time. Showing a request for review to a fulfillment worker just trying to ship an order isn’t likely going to work well.

Outreach after a milestone seems to work really well, something like “Congratulations on your xxth sale! We’re delighted that WooPayments facilitated this milestone. Would you consider sharing your experience and encouraging others by reviewing our plugin?”.

One other option to time a review request for optimal timing would be to setup a prompt that aligns with use patterns. For instance, if you know that most of your merchants use your plugin daily, you would likely send a review request sooner than a plugin that most merchants interact very sparingly with.

SaaS/Connector plugins need to be particularly careful about requesting ratings correctly, as they are the most likely to be overlooked unless there is an issue, leading to skewed ratings not representative of the actual plugin.

Requesting feedback at the end of every single support interaction (especially in the WordPress.org plugin repository). One of the largest barriers to leaving a review is the requirement of a user being logged into WooCommerce.com (or WordPress.org), and the WordPress.org support forums present a good opportunity to gather these reviews. By being highly responsive in the public support forum and solving issues there, users are already logged in and able to immediately leave a review (after being requested to!).


## Messaging for requesting reviews

One method of requesting feedback that we recommend, as it can both increase positive reviews as well as assist merchants struggling, is using the NPS style of review solicitation.

This is where we first ask the user how they rate the product (out of 5 stars), then route them based on their response:

* If they click 4 or 5 stars, ask them to leave a review.
* If they click 1,2,3, tell them we’re here to help & ask them to submit a support ticket

Merchants are significantly more likely to leave a review after a positive support interaction with one support rep explicitly asking for a review. The language “the best way to thank me is to leave a 5 star review that mentions me in it” or similar tends to work very well – people are more willing to help a person than a product/company.


## Miscellaneous guidelines and advice


Contributors' names matching search terms directly will rank extremely highly on the WordPress.org plugin repo, which means that having a WordPress.org user named after your business (if that's a search term for your plugin) could tilt the scales over a competing plugin.

Constant nags and overwhelming the admin dashboard with unnecessary alerts detract from this experience.

You can request to have reviews that are not actually feedback removed. Where this might be applicable is if the request is a simple support request, where it’s obviously in the wrong spot. 1 star reviews, even if aggressive or angry, are not usually removed.

Reply to reviews! Thank the giver for offering feedback, acknowledge the issue if needed, ask for more specific feedback, or provide an update when that feedback is addressed! Your reviews are a great window into what your plugin users are actually thinking.

Having folks close to the plugin development (think developers and project managers) looking at reviews on a regular basis is a good way to ensure the customers voice is heard. 1 star reviews are among the most useful, as long as the issue is understood and addressed (if needed).
